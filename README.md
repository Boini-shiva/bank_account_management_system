#Project Overview
The Bank Account Management System is a Python-based application that simulates banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and modifications to customer details. It follows an object-oriented approach (OOP), using a class Sbi to model a real-world banking system.
